## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

**Short Summary**
This challange was nice and easy to do.
Didn't have much problems, only with the margin, trying to align divs in center vertically.

I'm planning to use SASS, PHP, NODE.js in the future projects.
I'm also planning to learn Wordpress.
